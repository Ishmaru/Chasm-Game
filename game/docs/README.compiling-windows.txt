~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Build instructions for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Architecture

Developed on Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express (free version),
little endian CPU. Compiling using the mingw32 toolset is experimental, which
also allows for cross compiling.

On Debian GNU/Linux systems please find license information in: 
/usr/share/common-licenses

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. Building and Installation

2.1 Prerequesites

To build the game, the following tools and libraries must be present:

* Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2010
OR
* mingw32

* Experiemtnal Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2012 projects also exist in the vc2012
  folder

* MegaGlest Windows 32 bit dependencies for building with VC++:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/megaglest/files/windows_deps.7z/download
OR
* MegaGlest Windows 32 bit dependencies for building with mingw:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/megaglest/files/win32_deps_mingw.7z/download

These include:
* Xerces-C
  http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/
* wxWidgets
  http://wxwidgets.org/
And many more.

* For a more verbose list, please inspect the archive contents and refer to the
  Linux build instructions.


2.2 Building

To build and install the game proceed as follows:

Option A) (recommended) Automated build on the command line: 

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root folder where you have acquired the source code.

2. cd mk\windoze

3. build-mg-2010.bat (build-mg-2012.bat for vc 2012)

4. megaglest.exe --version

5. megaglest.exe

Option B) Using VC++ IDE:

1. Download the dependencies archive listed above and decompress its contents
   into the 'source' directory (where you see glest_game, g3d_viewer, etc).
   This should create a subdirectory called "win32_deps" with many files and
   subdirectories in it.

2. Start the Visual C++ 2010 IDE and open the solution file:
   \mk\windoze\Glest-2010.sln

3. Right Click on the top level 'Glest' node in Solution Explorer and select
   'Rebuild All'.

If you had no errors all binaries will be created in \data\glest_game.
Before running MegaGlest you must run CopyWindowsRuntimeDlls_2010.bat.
You should now be able to just run megaglest.exe.


2.3 Installation

We provide NSIS based installation packages. By default, these will create a
system-wide installation below %ProgramFiles% and setup Desktop icons for
simplified access. User specific configuration will be stored within the
directory tree the %AppData% environment variable points to.

3. Troubleshooting

Some hints for troubleshooting.

In General:
* Make sure both hard- and software of your system match the requirements
* Sound is played through OpenAL - you might need to take a look at your
  configuration: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/OpenAL_Configuration

Compiling:
* If configure fails make sure you have read the Building section above

Sound/Audio errors when starting:
* If the game doesn't start because of audio/sound errors:
  Make sure no other application is using your soundcard.
* If this doesn't solve your sound problems try to get an updated OpenAL from
  http://openal.org

The game complains about OpenGL 1.3 not available, is missing OpenGL extensions
or works very slowly:
* Try to get updated graphics drivers.

The game crashes:
* Check the forums at http://forums.megaglest.org/
* It would be nice if you could report any other crashes and freezes that are
  not yet described on the forums, preferably with a backtrace from a
  debugging enabled build
